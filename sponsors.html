	<p>SCiL is the main venue for research at the intersection of Linguistics and Computer Science. Supporting SCiL is an opportunity to put your corporate name in front of the computational linguists and natural language processing researchers that make up this community.</p>

	<p>This year's special Symposium on Computational Pragmatics presents an excellent opportunity to reach computational researchers who specialize on interactive, social aspects of language, a key research area in light of developments in LLM technology.</p>

	<p>If you are interested in sponsoring SCiL 2025, please contact the SCiL General Chair, Carolyn Anderson (carolyn.anderson@wellesley.edu).</p>

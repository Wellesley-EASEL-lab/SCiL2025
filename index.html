			<p>The Society for Computation in Linguistics will hold its eight meeting, SCiL 2025, from July 18-20th, 2025. It will be held on the campus of University of Oregon, co-located with the LSA Summer Institute.</p>

			<h3>Call for Papers</h3>

			<p>We seek high-quality research on computational and mathematical approaches in any area of linguistics. Submissions to SCiL should involve a substantial computational and/or mathematical modeling component, make direct contact with linguistics, and be written for an interdisciplinary audience. There will be two submission tracks: papers and abstracts, and two types of presentation: “talks” and “posters”.</p>

			<p>The conference will include both in-person and on-line presentations. For planning purposes, authors must specify whether they intend to present in-person or on-line, but this choice will not affect the selection procedure.</p>

			<p>Both papers and abstracts will be published online prior to the conference in the open-access SCiL proceedings. Authors of accepted abstracts will have the option to submit extended abstracts for publication. Papers will also be published in the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Anthology.</p>

			<h3>Special Symposium on Computational Pragmatics</h3>
			<p>A special Symposium on Computational Pragmatics will be held jointly with the annual meeting of SCiL. We hope to present an expansive vision of what computational pragmatics can be, encompassing cognitive modeling work on discourse processing, NLP applications that utilize ideas from pragmatics, and computational models that implement pragmatic theory.</p>

			<h4>Keynote Speakers:</h4><ul>
			<li>Malihe Alikhani, Assistant Professor of AI and social justice at the Khoury School of Computer Science at Northeastern University</li>
			<li>o Daniel Fried, Assistant Professor in the Language Technologies Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University </li>
			<li>o Junyi Jessy Li, Associate Professor in Linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin</li> 
			<li>o Hannah Rohde, Professor in Linguistics and English Language at the University of Edinburgh</li>
		</ul>

			<p>If you would like your submission to be considered for the Symposium, please indicate this at submission time.</p>

			<h4>Methodology Lightning Talk</h4>
			<p>As part of the Symposium on Computational Pragmatics, we will hold a special "show-and-tell" session for research methodologies in computational pragmatics. </p>
			<p>We welcome lightning talks (no more than 5 minutes) demonstrating a methodology. Talks need not present methodological innovations: the target audience is students and researchers who may be interested in adopting new methodologies for their work.</p>
			<p>If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, please submit a short abstract (100 words).</p>

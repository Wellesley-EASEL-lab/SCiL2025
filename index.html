	<h2>CS232: Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-7">
			
			<p>Artifical Intelligence is the study of how to build computer programs that can perform tasks like humans. This course traces the development of the field from the symbolic, knowledge-rich approaches of 20th century AI (e.g., rule-based systems), to statistical approaches that rely on increasingly large amounts of data, including an overview of contemporary deep learning techniques.</p>
			<p>We will explore how to apply these techniques in several AI application areas, including robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing, and consider ethical issues related to AI's impact on society.</p>
			<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
			<p>
				<p>+ Learn about a range of AI approaches, including rule-based/symbolic systems, statistical approaches, machine learning, and deep learning.</p>
				<p>+ Learn to recognize and choose appropriate techniques for a range of problems, including search, classification, and generation.</p>
				<p>+ Implement AI techniques in a variety of domains, including game-playing, robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing.</p>
				<p>+ Evaluate AI models with respect to both scientific validity and societal impact.</p>
				<p>+ Critically consider the ethical consequences of current and future AI technology.</p>

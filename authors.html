<h3>Poster presentation instructions</h3>
<div>

<p>We will have three poster sessions: 
<ul><li>July 18 (4-6 pm PDT): virtual poster session with zoom breakout rooms for each poster.</li>
	<li>July 19 (5:30-6:30 pm PDT): in-person poster session 1</li>
	<li>July 20 (2:45-3:45 pm PDT): in-person poster session 2</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>To make the hybrid experience engaging and inclusive for both virtual and in-person participants, we will have an in-person “viewing party” during the virtual poster session.</p> 

<h4>Virtual posters</h4>

<div>
	<p>To increase visibility of virtual posters, you will have:</p>
	<ul><li>A 5-minute lightning talk from each presenter to introduce their poster. You will join the zoom session as panelists, and will share your screen during your presentation. </li>
	<li>Opportunity to have your poster printed and displayed during the virtual poster session along with a paired laptop to allow in-person attendees to join your Zoom breakout room. </li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you would like us to print your poster, please send it to us by <b>July 10th</b></p>
</div>

<h4>In-person posters</h4>

<div>
	<ul><li>If you are presenting a poster in person, you will not give a lightning talk. Each in-person poster session will have only ~10 posters, which should provide plenty of time for discussion.</li>
	<li>The dimensions of the poster boards will be 57 ¾ inches wide x 46 inches tall.</li>
	<li>For the benefit of virtual participants, we ask that you upload a PDF of your poster to the shared drive (link emailed to authors separately) by the end of day, <b>July 17</b>. </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The Society for Computation in Linguistics will hold its eight meeting, SCiL 2025 on the campus of University of Oregon, co-located with the LSA Summer Institute. The conference will include both in-person and on-line presentations.</p>

<p>We seek high-quality research on computational and mathematical approaches in any area of linguistics. Submissions to SCiL should involve a substantial computational and/or mathematical modeling component, make direct contact with linguistics, and be written for an interdisciplinary audience. There will be two submission tracks: papers and abstracts, and two types of presentation: “talks” and “posters”.  Authors must specify at submission time whether they intend to present in-person or on-line. This information will be gathered for planning purposes, and the choice will not affect the selection procedure (i.e. we will not have a fixed number of on-line or in-person talks).</p>

<p>Both papers and abstracts will be published online prior to the conference in the open-access SCiL proceedings. Authors of accepted abstracts will have the option to submit extended abstracts for publication. Papers will also be published in the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Anthology.</p>

<p>There is no limit on the number of submissions per author.</p>

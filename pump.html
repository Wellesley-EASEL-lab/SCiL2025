	<p>SCiL 2025 is proud to host a <a href="http://genderinlinguistics.org/pump">Pop-Up Mentoring Program</a> (PUMP) event. PUMP (sponsored by the LSA <a href="http://genderinlinguistics.org/">Committee on Gender Equity</a>) provides on-site, one-off mentoring meetings at linguistics conferences around the world. PUMP matches one or more mentees with mentors who can provide quick but personalized career advice to linguists at any stage, in any location, and in any career: anyone can be a mentee or mentor, the more the merrier.</p>

	<p>You can register as a mentee or mentor <a href="https://forms.gle/7T1EENmwBwnRyLTt7">here</a>.</p>

	<p>We almost always have a lot of mentee interest so we especially encourage participants to apply as mentors if they think they can. Anyone can be a mentor! PhD students can mentor MA students, postdocs can be a wonderful resource for senior grad students, Assistant professors can mentor postdocs, and so on. We keep career stage and interests in mind when matching mentors and mentees.</p>

	<p>The deadline for registering as a mentee or a mentor for this event is <b>July 11th</b>.  After you register, you will receive an email matching you with your mentor or mentee, with details about how to meet. Please email Carolyn Anderson (carolyn.anderson@wellesley.edu) with any questions about the PUMP event.</p>
